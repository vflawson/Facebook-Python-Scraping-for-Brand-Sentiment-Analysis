# Facebook-Python-Scraping-for-Brand-Sentiment-Analysis
Python scraping of Facebook comments on official brand page for NLP-based brand sentiment analysis 

Leveraging facebook_scraper package, I pulled comments from the first 25 pages of the official brand page of a target company.

This data will be used for an NLP-based sentiment analysis on the target brand. In this case, I used Toyota as a case company.
